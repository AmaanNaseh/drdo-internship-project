# Robotic Arm Project : Pick and Place Robot with integrated AI Vision System

This project is made during internship in SSPL DRDO in July 2025. It combines knowledge from Robotics, IOT & AI in order to bring out a real life product. Currently, we have developed it on low scale just to showcase an example such as detecting and picking red colored objects selectively.
